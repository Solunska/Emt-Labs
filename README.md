# Library Management System

As part of my EMT lab series, I developed a **Library Management System** using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The application allows librarians to manage the inventory of books in a library by providing features such as adding, editing, deleting, and marking books as rented.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API** development with **Spring Boot**, following a layered architecture with controllers, services, and repositories.
- Frontend built with **React**, implementing routing, state management using **useState**, and handling API requests.
- **Pagination** for displaying books and interactive features like **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Mark As Taken** for managing books.
- **H2 Database** integration for storing book, author, and category data.
- Addressed **CORS** issues for seamless integration between frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** (Backend)
- **React** (Frontend)
- **H2 Database** (In-memory database)
- **JavaScript/JSX**
- **CSS**
- **REST APIs**
